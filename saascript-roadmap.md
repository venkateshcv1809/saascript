# SaaScript Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level strategic roadmap for the **SaaScript** project, detailing its major phases, key milestones, and overarching goals for each stage. This complements the detailed task list by providing a broader view of the project's progression.

---

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup & Core Services

**Goal:** Establish a robust, containerized local development environment and foundational observability tools to support microservices development.

**Key Milestones:**
* Fully functional local development environment with all core infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, DynamoDB local) via Docker Compose.
* Centralized logging (Loki, Promtail) and metrics (Prometheus) established for all services.
* Grafana dashboards configured for visualization of logs and metrics.
* Basic CI/CD pipeline structure (e.g., using a local Jenkins/DroneCI instance) implemented for automated testing.

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Management

**Goal:** Implement a secure, scalable authentication service and a flexible user profile management system.

**Key Milestones:**
* Authentication Service API designed with clear endpoints, DTOs, and schema.
* Core logic for user registration, login, token generation (JWT), and secure password hashing implemented.
* Authentication Service integrated with PostgreSQL for user data storage.
* NestJS JWT validation guard and basic role-based authorization implemented.
* User Profile Service API designed.
* User Profile Service core logic implemented using DynamoDB for flexible profile data.

## Phase 3: Subscription & Payment Gateway Integration

**Goal:** Develop the subscription management service and integrate with a payment gateway.

**Key Milestones:**
* Subscription Service API designed.
* Core subscription logic (plan management, user subscriptions) implemented.
* Integration with a chosen payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure transactions.
* Webhook handling for payment events (success, failure, refunds).

---

## Phase 4: Microservice Communication & API Gateway

**Goal:** Optimize inter-service communication and establish a central API gateway.

**Key Milestones:**
* Implement event-driven communication patterns between services using Kafka.
* Implement command/task-based communication patterns using RabbitMQ.
* Develop the central NestJS API Gateway for routing and initial request validation.
* Integrate API Gateway with Authentication Service for centralized token validation.

---

## Phase 5: Core SaaS Features & Tenant Management

**Goal:** Implement initial core SaaS features and basic multi-tenancy capabilities.

**Key Milestones:**
* Design and implement a generic "Tenant" module for multi-tenancy.
* Example core SaaS feature service developed (e.g., a simple project management service).
* Data isolation enforced for multi-tenant data where applicable.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment & Scalability Enhancements

**Goal:** Prepare for production deployment and enhance scalability.

**Key Milestones:**
* Containerization optimization for production deployment.
* Kubernetes deployment manifests for core services.
* Horizontal scaling mechanisms for services tested.
* Advanced monitoring and alerting configured.

---

## Phase 7: Frontend Development & UI Integration

**Goal:** Develop the main user interface and integrate with backend services.

**Key Milestones:**
* Next.js application setup with React UI components.
* Authentication and user profile pages implemented.
* Integration with the API Gateway for all backend communication.
* Implement core SaaS feature UI.
