# SaaScript

## A Comprehensive SaaS Blueprint and Framework in a Monorepo Structure

Welcome to the **SaaScript** monorepo! This project serves as a robust, scalable, and modular blueprint for building modern SaaS applications using the TypeScript and Node.js ecosystem. It's designed to provide a ready-to-use codebase and architectural foundation, allowing developers to focus on their unique business logic rather than boilerplate infrastructure.

### Project Vision

Our vision is to offer a comprehensive, end-to-end SaaS framework that enables developers to rapidly build, customize, and self-host scalable, robust, and full-featured SaaS applications.

### Core Principles

* AI-Assisted Development: Leveraging AI tools and processes to maximize efficiency across the entire software development lifecycle.
* Automation First: Automate repetitive and complex tasks with "single-command" scripts.
* Convention Over Configuration: Embrace structured frameworks (NestJS, React with Next.js) to enforce consistency and maintainability.
* Modular & Reusable: Designed with independent microservices and components for high reusability.
* API-First: Clear, consistent, and well-documented APIs for all services.
* Scalable & Resilient: Architected to handle high loads and ensure high availability.
* Security-First: Built with robust security practices at every layer.
* TypeScript-First: Prioritizing TypeScript for robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

### Technology Stack Highlights

* **Backend:** NestJS (TypeScript/Node.js)
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Transactional), DynamoDB (User Profiles)
* **Caching/Session:** Redis
* **Messaging/Queues:** RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
* **Frontend:** React with Next.js Framework
* **Deployment:** Kubernetes (K8s) with Minikube for local dev
* **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault

### Monorepo Structure

This monorepo is organized into the following top-level directories:

* `modules/`: Houses individual backend microservices (e.g., `auth`, `billing`, `api-gateway`).
* `frontend/`: Contains frontend applications (e.g., `frontend/web` for the public site, `frontend/admin` for the admin panel).
* `docs/`: Comprehensive project documentation, architectural diagrams, and guides.
* `scripts/`: Root-level automation scripts for development, testing, and deployment.
