# SaaScript Project Overview - Detailed Context for AI Team

This document provides the comprehensive context for the **SaaScript** project, intended to bring any AI team member up to speed with its vision, architecture, and core technological stack. It serves as the single source of truth for all foundational project information, principles, and team collaboration guidelines relevant to SaaScript.

---

## 1. Overarching Goals & Motivation (Venkat's Vision)

-   **User:** Venkat. You can call me "Venkat" in conversation, but "VENKATESH C V" for formal documentation.
-   **Core Goal:** To showcase full-stack AI/ML development skills, build a tangible portfolio for freelancing, leverage AI to avoid burnout, and gain deep Python experience.
-   **The Three Pillars of the Ecosystem (Evolution of Understanding):**
    1.  **SaaScript (The TypeScript Blueprint/Framework for SaaS):**
        -   **Initial Thought:** The _first_ project idea conceived: a comprehensive, end-to-end SaaS blueprint and framework.
        -   **Role:** Provides a full suite of common, reusable SaaS services implemented in the TypeScript/Node.js stack. Its core purpose is to act as a **ready-to-use codebase and architecture blueprint** that developers can take, customize with their core logic, and **self-host** to launch their own SaaS applications.
        -   **Relationship to PySaaS:** **Identical in concept and the core SaaS services provided** to PySaaS; it serves as the TypeScript implementation of a robust SaaS framework.
        -   **Key Scope Defined in this Document:** This Master Project Document defines the scope for detailed plans covering Payment & Subscription Management, User Onboarding, Advanced Security, Internationalization (I18n) & Localization (L10n), and Customer Support.
    2.  **PySaaS (The Python Framework for SaaS):**
        -   **Initial Thought:** A Python-based parallel to SaaScript, conceived later to leverage Python expertise.
        -   **Role:** Provides a full suite of common, reusable SaaS services implemented in the Python stack. Its core purpose is to act as a **ready-to-use codebase and architecture blueprint** that developers can take, customize with their core logic, and **self-host** to launch their own SaaS applications.
        -   **Relationship to SaaScript:** **Identical in concept and the core SaaS services provided** to SaaScript; it serves as the Python implementation of a robust SaaS framework. Archi (AI) assists in translating/implementing ideas from SaaScript into Python.
    3.  **FilmForgeFX (The Example Application):**
        -   **Initial Thought:** A standalone AI image transforming application, potentially a core end-product tightly coupled with PySaaS/SaaScript.
        -   **Pivoted Understanding:** Now considered an **_example_ of an existing core application** (with ML/AI as its core service) that a developer (like Venkat) would take the `PySaaS` or `SaaScript` framework, integrate their `FilmForgeFX` logic into it, and then **self-host** that combined application as a SaaS.
        -   **Core Function:** AI-based "Image-to-Movie-Style Adaptation" (transforming images into stylized characters/elements from animated movies).
        -   **Key Nuance for AI:** Archi should aim for **literal character/entity adaptation** even if it means transforming a human input into a non-human form (e.g., human to "Cars" vehicle, human to "Turbo" racing snail/entity), as long as the result is fun and visually compelling. (This clarifies a past misunderstanding where AI initially hesitated on literal "human to snail" transformation, but embraced "human to car").
        -   **Relationship:** It's a _separate_ Git repository. Its core logic would be integrated into a copy of the PySaaS/SaaScript framework by a developer, who would then self-host the complete SaaS application.

## 2. Project Vision & Goals (SaaScript Specific)

-   **Project Name:** SaaScript
-   **Project Goal:** To build a robust, scalable, and modular SaaS application demonstrating modern microservices architecture, leveraging AI to maximize solo developer efficiency across the entire software development lifecycle.
-   **Vision:** To provide a comprehensive, end-to-end SaaS blueprint and framework that enables developers to rapidly build, customize, and **self-host** scalable, robust, and full-featured SaaS applications using the TypeScript stack. It acts as a parallel alternative (codebase/framework) to PySaaS (Python-based).
-   **Mission:** To offer a **ready-to-use framework** with reusable and extensible modules for common SaaS functionalities, allowing developers to focus on their core business logic for their own self-hosted applications rather than boilerplate infrastructure.
-   **Target Audience:** Developers and businesses looking to "SaaSify" their existing core software or build new SaaS applications efficiently.

## 3. Core Principles & Philosophy

-   **AI as Your Co-Pilot:** Integrate AI assistance at every stage (Design, Develop, Test, Document, Deploy, Maintain).
-   **Automation First:** Automate repetitive and complex tasks with "single-command" scripts.
-   **Convention Over Configuration:** Embrace structured frameworks to enforce consistency and maintainability.
-   **Learning & Exploration:** Prioritize hands-on experience with technologies common in large-scale applications.
-   **Reusability:** Design modules to be standalone and easily integrated into other SaaS contexts.
-   **TypeScript-First:** Leveraging TypeScript for robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase.
-   **Modular & Reusable:** Designed with microservices/components that are independent and interchangeable.
-   **API-First:** Clear, consistent, and well-documented APIs for all services.
-   **Scalable & Resilient:** Architected to handle high loads and ensure high availability.
-   **Security-First:** Built with robust security practices at every layer.

## 4. Project Constraints: Budget (Time-Only)

A core constraint for the SaaScript project is that the only allocated budget is **time**. This explicitly means:

* **No Direct Monetary Cost:** All chosen technologies, libraries, frameworks, and core tools must be open-source and free to use, specifically for self-hosting where applicable.
* **Prioritization of Free & Open-Source Alternatives:** When multiple options exist, preference will always be given to solutions that do not incur licensing or subscription fees (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana over Datadog).
* **Self-Hosted Solutions:** For services that offer both a paid SaaS version and a free, self-hostable open-source version (e.g., Sentry, PostHog, HashiCorp Vault), the self-hostable open-source variant will be utilized for the project's development and initial deployment.
* **Operational Costs Not Covered (Post-Deployment):** While development libraries/SDKs for services like payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) are free to integrate, it is acknowledged that actual live production usage of such services will incur transaction or operational fees. These operational costs are outside the scope of the project's development budget constraint.

This constraint ensures the project remains achievable within defined time limits without requiring external financial investment.

## 5. Finalized Technology Stack

This is the complete technology stack chosen for the SaaScript project:

-   **Project Development Methodology:** AI-assisted, **TDD-first workflow**, with detailed documentation.
-   **Backend Framework:** NestJS (TypeScript/Node.js) for all microservices (including the API Gateway).
-   **Core Transactional Database:** PostgreSQL (for core transactional data like Auth, Payments, etc.).
-   **Session Management & Caching:** Redis (for sessions, caching, rate limiting).
-   **User Profile Preferences Database:** DynamoDB (for a dedicated User Profile module, handling flexible user settings and preferences).
-   **Messaging & Queueing:**
    -   RabbitMQ (for reliable task queues and traditional message queuing).
    -   Apache Kafka (for high-throughput event streaming and event sourcing).
-   **API Gateway:** NestJS (Custom Implementation). (Future backlog: GraphQL layer for frontends).
-   **Frontend Framework:** React (with Next.js Framework). (Future backlog: Mobile development).
-   **Deployment & Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s), with Minikube for local development (leveraging its Podman driver).
-   **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana (self-hosted), Sentry (self-hosted open-source for error monitoring).
-   **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault.

## 6. Module Design Principles for Reusability

These principles guide the design and implementation of each SaaScript microservice to ensure they are truly independent, maintainable, and scalable.

-   **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion:**
    -   **Definition:** Services communicate via well-defined public APIs, without knowledge of each other's internal implementations or direct database access. Each service is responsible for a single, focused business capability (e.g., Auth handles only identity management).
    -   **Benefits:** Enhanced reusability, easier maintenance, independent scalability.
-   **Clear API Contracts (RESTful & Standardized):**
    -   **Definition:** Services expose explicit contracts for communication, specifying endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response formats, and status codes. This adheres to RESTful API design.
    -   **Implementation:** Use NestJS decorators, TypeScript typing, and DTOs to enforce clear API definitions. Utilize `@nestjs/swagger` for OpenAPI documentation generation.
    -   **Standardization:**
        -   **Consistent Base Paths and Versioning:** All services will use consistent base paths (e.g., `/api/v1/` or `/service-name/v1/`).
        -   **Clear Resource Naming:** Use nouns for resources (`/users`, `/subscriptions`).
        -   **Appropriate HTTP Methods:** Use GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE for their intended actions.
        -   **Consistent Request/Response Formats:** Primarily JSON for bodies and responses.
        -   **Standardized Error Handling:** Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500) with a consistent JSON error structure (`error_code`, `message`).
        -   **Authentication & Authorization Headers:** Use Bearer Tokens (JWTs) in the `Authorization` header; standardized `X-Refresh-Token` for token refreshing.
        -   **Pagination, Filtering, Sorting:** Standardized query parameters (e.g., `?page=1&size=20`, `?status=active`, `?sort_by=created_at&order=desc`).
        -   **Idempotency:** Design PUT and DELETE operations to be idempotent.
    -   **Benefits:** Predictability, faster integration, versionability, and a developer-friendly experience for applications consuming the blueprint.
-   **Independent Deployability:**
    -   **Definition:** Each service can be developed, tested, deployed, updated, and rolled back independently.
    -   **Implementation:** Each microservice will have its own Dockerfile to create self-contained container images.
    -   **Benefits:** Rapid iteration, reduced risk, development efficiency.
-   **Scalability (Statelessness is Key):**
    -   **Definition:** Services should be stateless, externalizing any session or request-specific data to shared, highly available stores.
    -   **Implementation:** JWT-based authentication, Redis for session data/caching.
    -   **Benefits:** Elasticity, resilience, efficient resource utilization.
-   **Security:**
    -   **Definition:** Security is built into every layer: authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure handling of credentials.
    -   **Implementation:** Auth module for identity, API Gateway for initial validation, NestJS pipes for input validation, secure secret management in Kubernetes.
-   **Multi-Tenancy Strategy (Shared Database with Tenant ID):**
    -   **Definition:** Implement a shared database segregated by a `tenant_id` column as the primary strategy for allowing multiple customer organizations (tenants) to use a single deployed instance while keeping their data isolated.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Every API request will carry a `tenant_id` (derived during authentication or as a dedicated header).
        -   Almost every table containing tenant-specific data will include a `tenant_id` column.
        -   All database queries will automatically include a `WHERE tenant_id = <current_tenant_id>` clause.
        -   Application logic will strictly enforce `tenant_id` throughout its operations.
    -   **Benefits:** Efficient for deployment and scaling, while offering robust data isolation.
-   **Data Ownership & Isolation:**
    -   **Definition:** Each project (SaaScript blueprint services, FilmForgeFX core application) is responsible for managing its own dedicated database(s) for its specific domain of data.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   **Blueprint Data:** SaaScript/PySaaS manage data essential for running the SaaS framework (e.g., user auth, billing, tenant metadata) typically in PostgreSQL.
        -   **Core Application Data:** FilmForgeFX manages data related to its core AI functionality (e.g., transformed images, requests, AI model configs) in its own dedicated database(s).
        -   **Inter-Database Communication:** No direct database-to-database communication. All interactions occur via API calls (e.g., FilmForgeFX queries SaaScript's Auth API for `tenant_id`, then uses it to query its own database).
    -   **Benefits:** Cleaner architecture, easier maintenance, better scalability, strong separation of concerns.

## 7. SaaScript Project Management Guide: Collaborative Development with AI

### 7.2. Workflow Execution

-   **Model:** Our workflow will largely follow a **Kanban-like system**, focusing on a continuous flow of tasks rather than fixed-length sprints.
-   **Task Definition & Breakdown:**
    -   **Phases:** High-level groupings of related Epics (e.g., "Auth Microservice").
    -   **Epics:** Large features or logical components within a phase, requiring multiple GitHub Issues (e.g., "JWT Strategy & Guards").
    -   **GitHub Issues:** The smallest unit of work, defining a single, actionable task with clear goals and acceptance criteria. Each issue will be self-contained and aim to be completed within a reasonable timeframe.
-   **Task Tracking:**
    -   **Primary Tool:** GitHub Issues and a GitHub Kanban board (or similar project board feature within GitHub) will be used to track the status of all tasks.
    -   **Columns (Example):**
        -   **To Do**
        -   **In Progress**
        -   **Review**
        -   **Done**
-   **Deadlines:** While embracing agility, target deadlines will be set for Phases and Epics to maintain momentum. Daily progress will be communicated.

### 8.1. Overall Workflow Process (AI-Assisted)

Our development workflow is tailored for an AI-assisted monorepo environment, focusing on clear, iterative steps.

1.  **Task Identification & Breakdown:**
    -   **Initiator:** Venkat (Project Lead) identifies a feature, bug, or improvement.
    -   **Collaboration:** Venkat and Archi collaboratively break it down into an Epic, then into granular GitHub Issues. Archi helps define scope, sub-tasks, and initial estimates.
2.  **Issue Assignment & Development:**
    -   **Assignment:** Issues are assigned to either "AI" or "VENKATESH C V" on the GitHub project board.
    -   **AI Development:** If assigned to AI, Archi generates code, documentation, or suggestions based on the issue's requirements.
    -   **Human Development:** If assigned to Venkat, you implement the task.
3.  **Local Implementation & Testing:**
    -   Developers (human or AI-assisted) implement the changes locally, following the TDD-first approach where applicable.
    -   Comprehensive unit and integration tests are written and pass.
    -   Local checks (linting, formatting) are run.
4.  **Version Control (Git):**
    -   Changes are committed to a feature branch using Conventional Commits.
    -   A Pull Request (PR) is created targeting `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes).
5.  **Code Review & Quality Assurance:**
    -   **Primary Reviewer:** Venkat reviews all AI-generated code and human-written code.
    -   **Feedback & Iteration:** Review comments are addressed, leading to further commits on the feature branch.
    -   Automated CI/CD checks (lint, tests, coverage) must pass.
6.  **Merge & Deployment:**
    -   Once approved, the feature branch is merged.
    -   Automated deployment to staging/production environments (future CI/CD phases).

### 8.2. Simplified Gitflow Branching Strategy

We will use a simplified Gitflow model adapted for our rapid, AI-assisted development.

-   **`main` branch:**
    -   **Purpose:** Represents the production-ready code.
    -   **Access:** Highly protected. Only merges from `develop` (for releases) or `hotfix-*` branches are allowed.
    -   **Commits:** No direct commits.
-   **`develop` branch:**
    -   **Purpose:** Integrates all completed features and bug fixes. It represents the next release candidate.
    -   **Access:** Protected. Direct pushes are discouraged. Only merges from feature branches or hotfix branches.
    -   **Commits:** No direct commits.
-   **`feature/<feature-name>` branches:**
    -   **Purpose:** For all new features, enhancements, or non-urgent bug fixes.
    -   **Origin:** Branched off `develop`.
    -   **Lifetime:** Short-lived, deleted after merging into `develop`.
    -   **Naming Convention:** `feature/auth-jwt-strategy`, `feature/billing-subscription-api`.
-   **`bugfix/<bug-description>` branches:**
    -   **Purpose:** For urgent bug fixes that don't warrant a hotfix release (i.e., can wait for the next regular release).
    -   **Origin:** Branched off `develop`.
    -   **Lifetime:** Short-lived, deleted after merging into `develop`.
    -   **Naming Convention:** `bugfix/auth-login-issue`, `bugfix/billing-webhook-error`.
-   **`hotfix/<hotfix-description>` branches:**
    -   **Purpose:** For critical, immediate fixes to production code.
    -   **Origin:** Branched directly off `main`.
    -   **Lifetime:** Short-lived. Merged back into both `main` (for immediate release) and `develop` (to ensure the fix is in the next regular release).
    -   **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/prod-auth-critical-bug`.

### 8.3. Commit Message Conventions (Conventional Commits)

We will use Conventional Commits to maintain a highly readable and automated changelog.

-   **Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
    -   **`<type>` (Mandatory):**
        -   `feat`: A new feature (correlates with `minor` in SemVer).
        -   `fix`: A bug fix (correlates with `patch` in SemVer).
        -   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
        -   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.).
        -   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
        -   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
        -   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
        -   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files (e.g., build process, auxiliary tools, libraries).
        -   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., npm, yarn, gulp).
        -   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (e.g., GitHub Actions).
    -   **`<scope>` (Optional, but recommended for microservices):** The module or area of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `api-gateway`, `frontend-web`, `billing`).
    -   **`<description>` (Mandatory):** A short, imperative, present tense description of the change.
-   **Examples:**
    -   `feat(auth): Implement user registration endpoint`
    -   `fix(billing): Correct webhook processing error`
    -   `docs(architecture): Add multi-tenancy strategy section`

    -   `refactor(user-profile): Improve DTO validation logic`
    -   `perf(api-gateway): Optimize rate limiting middleware`

### 8.4. Pull Request (PR) Strategy & Template

All significant changes (features, bug fixes, enhancements) will go through a PR process.

-   **Purpose:** Facilitate code review, ensure quality, and serve as a record of changes.
-   **PR Creation:**
    -   Opened from a `feature/*` or `bugfix/*` branch.
    -   Target `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes).
    -   Linked to its corresponding GitHub Issue.
-   **PR Template (`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`):**
    -   A standardized template will guide PR authors to provide necessary context. (The content for this template is in the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file.)
-   **Review Process:**
    -   Automated CI/CD checks run upon PR creation/update.
    -   Venkat reviews the code, comments, requests changes.
    -   Archi (AI) can assist in preliminary code quality checks (e.g., suggesting improvements, identifying potential bugs).
    -   Approval by Venkat is required before merging.

## 9. SaaScript Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines the essential processes and considerations for maintaining the SaaScript application, ensuring its long-term stability, security, and performance.

### 9.1. Upgradation & Migration Process

Regular upgrades of dependencies, frameworks, and infrastructure are crucial.

-   **Dependency Upgrades (npm packages):**
    -   **Process:** Regularly review and update project dependencies. Utilize tools like `npm outdated` and `npm update`. For major version upgrades, review changelogs for breaking changes.
    -   **Automation:** Incorporate dependency update checks into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Dependabot, RenovateBot).
-   **Framework Upgrades (NestJS, Next.js):**
    -   **Process:** For major framework versions, dedicated upgrade guides are often provided by the framework authors. Follow these meticulously, addressing breaking changes and migrating deprecated features.
    -   **Testing:** Thoroughly re-test all affected modules after framework upgrades.
-   **Database Migrations (PostgreSQL):**
    -   **Process:** Use TypeORM's migration capabilities to manage schema changes.
    -   **Workflow:**
        1.  Generate migration files for schema changes.
        2.  Write `up` and `down` scripts for each migration.
        3.  Test migrations locally against development database.
        4.  Ensure roll-back procedures are well-defined and tested.
-   **DynamoDB (Schema Evolution):**
    -   **Process:** DynamoDB is schemaless at the table level, but schema evolution at the item level requires careful application-side handling. Use versioning within the item structure (e.g., `item_version: 1`) and write code that can handle older data formats.
    -   **Backfills:** For significant changes, plan data backfill operations carefully.
-   **Container Image Updates:**
    -   **Process:** Regularly update base images (e.g., Node.js, Alpine) in Dockerfiles to incorporate security patches and performance improvements.
    -   **Rebuild:** Rebuild all service container images after base image updates.
-   **Kubernetes Version Upgrades:**
    -   **Process:** For local Minikube and future cloud K8s clusters, plan and execute version upgrades. Review Kubernetes release notes for new features, deprecations, and breaking changes.
    -   **Tools:** Utilize `minikube update` and `kubectl drain`/`uncordon` for graceful node upgrades.

### 9.2. Ongoing Maintenance Tasks

Beyond upgrades, consistent operational tasks ensure the health of the application.

-   **Monitoring & Logging Review:**
    -   **Process:** Regularly review dashboards (Grafana), logs (Loki), and error alerts (Sentry) to identify anomalies, performance bottlenecks, or recurring errors.
    -   **Action:** Investigate and address issues proactively.
-   **Bug Fixing:**
    -   **Process:** Prioritize and address bugs identified through monitoring, user reports, or internal testing, following the bugfix branching strategy.
-   **Security Patching:**
    -   **Process:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities in dependencies and frameworks. Apply patches promptly.
    -   **Automation:** Leverage tools like `npm audit` and integrate security scanning into CI/CD.
-   **Performance Tuning:**
    -   **Process:** Based on monitoring data and load test results, identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., slow queries, inefficient code, resource contention).
    -   **Action:** Optimize code, database queries, and infrastructure configurations.
-   **Backup and Restore (Data Management):**
    -   **Process:** Implement automated daily/weekly backups for all persistent data stores (PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Redis data if persistent).
    -   **Testing:** Periodically test restore procedures to ensure data recoverability.
-   **Documentation Updates:**
    -   **Process:** Keep all project documentation (architecture, local dev guide, module READMEs) up-to-date with any changes or new features.
-   **Resource Scaling:**
    -   **Process:** Adjust Kubernetes replica counts, database sizes, or queue configurations based on observed load and performance.

## 10. Comprehensive Documentation & Automation

This section formalizes all project documentation and implements robust "single-command" automation scripts, crucial for efficiency.

### 10.1. Documenting Architecture & Local Dev

-   **Goal:** Maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for the project's architecture and local development setup.
-   **Detailed Steps:**
    -   Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with detailed diagrams of services, databases, queues, and API Gateway (using Mermaid.js for diagrams).
    -   Update `docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` with complete, step-by-step instructions for setting up the entire monorepo with `podman-compose` and Minikube.
    -   Create module-specific `README.md` files (e.g., `modules/auth/README.md`) detailing API endpoints, environment variables, and run/test instructions for each microservice.
-   **Archi's (AI) Role:**
    -   Generate Mermaid diagrams based on architectural decisions.
    -   Write detailed setup instructions for `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`.
    -   Populate module `README.md` templates with relevant information.
-   **Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive documentation covering architecture and local development, making onboarding new contributors seamless.

### 10.2. Single-Command Automation Scripts

-   **Goal:** Implement root-level npm scripts for common development and operational tasks, enabling a "single-command" workflow.
-   **Detailed Steps:**
    -   Add root-level npm scripts to `saascript/package.json` for tasks such as:
        -   `dev:all`: Starts all services locally via `podman-compose`.
        -   `stop:all`: Stops all services locally.
        -   `test:all`: Runs tests across all modules.
        -   `build:all`: Builds all container images.
        -   `k8s:start`: Starts Minikube.
        -   `k8s:stop`: Stops Minikube.
        -   `k8s:deploy:all`: Applies all Kubernetes manifests.
        -   `lint:fix:all`: Automatically fixes linting errors across the monorepo.
        -   `format:all`: Formats code consistently across the monorepo.
    -   Implement shell scripts in a `scripts/` directory for more complex automation if needed (e.g., a script to load all built images into Minikube, or a health-check script for Kubernetes deployments).
-   **Archi's (AI) Role:**
    -   Generate shell script content for various automation tasks.
    -   Suggest efficient npm script combinations for composite tasks.
-   **Expected Outcome:** A powerful set of single-line commands to manage the entire SaaScript project lifecycle, from development to deployment.

## 11. Observability & Monitoring

This section details the implementation of comprehensive logging, tracing, metrics, and error monitoring across both backend and frontend to understand service health and debug issues effectively.

### 11.1. Structured Logging & Distributed Tracing

-   **Goal:** Implement consistent structured logging across all NestJS microservices and enable distributed tracing to track requests across service boundaries.
-   **Detailed Steps:**
    -   In NestJS services, replace default `console.log` with a structured logger (e.g., Winston or Pino) to output logs in a parseable format (JSON).
    -   (Optional) Set up a simple Loki/Promtail/Grafana stack locally (via `podman-compose` or Kubernetes manifests) for centralized log aggregation, making it easier to search and analyze logs from all services.
    -   Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to automatically propagate trace contexts across microservices, allowing visualization of request flows and identification of latency bottlenecks.
-   **Archi's (AI) Role:**
    -   Provide code snippets for integrating Winston or Pino with NestJS.
    -   Suggest logging best practices, including appropriate log levels and context enrichment.
    -   Generate `podman-compose.yaml` definitions for setting up Loki/Promtail/Grafana.
    -   Assist with OpenTelemetry integration patterns for NestJS.
-   **Expected Outcome:** Consistent, structured logs from all microservices, with distributed tracing enabled for end-to-end request visibility.

### 11.2. Basic Metrics & Monitoring

-   **Goal:** Expose key performance metrics from backend services and set up a basic monitoring stack for visualization and alerting.
-   **Detailed Steps:**
    -   Integrate a metrics library (e.g., `prom-client`) into NestJS services to expose Prometheus-compatible metrics (e.g., request rates, error rates, latencies, CPU/memory usage).
    -   Set up a local Prometheus instance (via `podman-compose` or Kubernetes manifests) configured to scrape metrics from the deployed microservices.
    -   Set up a local Grafana instance to visualize metrics from Prometheus.
    -   Create basic Grafana dashboards for critical operational metrics like CPU utilization, RAM usage, and request rates per service.
-   **Archi's (AI) Role:**
    -   Provide code snippets for exposing Prometheus metrics from NestJS applications.
    -   Generate Prometheus configuration for scraping targets.
    -   Suggest basic Grafana dashboard queries to monitor essential service health indicators.
-   **Expected Outcome:** Basic monitoring of service health and performance, providing insights into operational status.

### 11.3. Frontend Error Monitoring & APM

-   **Goal:** Implement real-time error tracking and performance monitoring for the frontend application to quickly identify and resolve user-facing issues.
-   **Detailed Steps:**
    -   Integrate a dedicated error monitoring and Application Performance Management (APM) tool SDK (e.g., Sentry) into the Next.js frontend application (`frontend/web`).
    -   Configure the SDK to automatically capture unhandled exceptions, promise rejections, network errors, and other relevant client-side issues.
    -   Set up basic performance monitoring to track key frontend interactions and page load times.
    -   Define alert rules within the monitoring tool for critical frontend errors to ensure prompt notification.
    -   Document the Sentry integration process and provide guidelines on how to interpret error reports and performance traces.
-   **Archi's (AI) Role:**
    -   Provide installation steps and basic Sentry SDK configuration for Next.js.
    -   Suggest how to capture additional context (e.g., authenticated user ID, breadcrumbs leading up to an error).
    -   Assist with setting up initial alert configurations for common frontend issues.
-   **Expected Outcome:** Real-time capture and reporting of frontend application errors and performance issues, enabling faster debugging and improved user experience.
