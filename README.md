# SaaScript Monorepo

## Overview

SaaScript is a TypeScript-focused monorepo designed to facilitate the development of modular SaaS applications. This repository contains multiple modules, a frontend application, shared resources, and scripts for deployment and management.

## Directory Structure

- **modules/**: Contains individual SaaS modules, each with its own source code, configuration, and dependencies.
  - **module1/**: An example module with its own entry point and configuration.
- **frontend/**: The frontend application built with React, containing components, entry points, and configuration files.
- **scripts/**: Contains utility scripts for deployment and other tasks.
- **shared/**: Holds shared types and interfaces that can be used across different modules and the frontend.

## High-Level Architecture

The project is structured around a microservices architecture, where each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The frontend application is designed to consume these modules and provide a seamless user experience.

### Key Components

- **TypeScript Modules**: Each module is developed in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better maintainability.
- **React Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts are provided to streamline the deployment process, making it easier to manage the application lifecycle.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SaaScript monorepo, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies for each module and the frontend application. Follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` files within each directory for detailed setup and usage information.
