# Project Management Approach

This document outlines the agile-inspired project management approach for the SaaScript monorepo, emphasizing our philosophy, toolset, and iteration cycles. The goal is to maintain transparency, enable efficient progress tracking, and foster a collaborative environment.

## 1. Philosophy & Principles

* **Agile-Inspired:** We adopt principles from Agile methodologies, focusing on iterative development, flexibility, and rapid response to change.
* **Transparency:** All project progress, issues, and decisions are visible and accessible to team members.
* **Prioritization:** Work is prioritized based on project vision, technical dependencies, and impact.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review processes and adapt them based on lessons learned.
* **AI Augmentation:** Leverage the AI Co-Developer to assist in planning, task breakdown, estimation, and status reporting.

## 2. Tools & Platforms

* **GitHub Issues:** Primary tool for:
    * Defining and tracking individual tasks, bugs, and features.
    * Linking to relevant code (via PRs) and discussions.
    * Managing project milestones and assigning responsibilities.
* **GitHub Projects (Kanban Board):** Used for visualizing workflow and tracking progress:
    * **To Do:** Tasks identified but not yet started.
    * **In Progress:** Tasks actively being worked on.
    * **In Review:** Pull Requests awaiting code review.
    * **Done:** Completed tasks and merged Pull Requests.
* **GitHub Wiki / Docs Folder:** For comprehensive documentation, architectural decisions, and setup guides.
* **Chat Platform:** For real-time communication and quick questions.

## 3. Iteration Cycles & Cadence

While not strictly Scrum, we operate in an iterative fashion, focusing on delivering value incrementally.

* **Iterations:** Work is organized into logical iterations, typically aligning with phases of the Master Project Plan (e.g., Phase 0: Foundations, Phase 1: Authentication).
* **Daily Check-ins (Asynchronous/Synchronous):** Brief updates on progress, blockers, and immediate next steps. This can be via chat or a quick sync-up.
* **Bi-weekly (or As-Needed) Review & Planning:** Regular sessions to:
    * Review completed work.
    * Refine the backlog.
    * Plan upcoming tasks.
    * Address any impediments.

## 4. Issue Management Best Practices

* **Single Source of Truth:** GitHub Issues are the definitive source for all work items.
* **Clear Descriptions:** Issues should be well-defined with clear goals, acceptance criteria, and context.
* **Labeling:** Use labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `docs`, `priority: high`, `phase-0`) for categorization and filtering.
* **Assignees:** Assign issues to the individual responsible for them.
* **Milestones:** Group related issues into milestones to track progress towards larger goals.
* **Linking PRs:** Always link Pull Requests to their respective issues (e.g., `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description).

## 5. Decision Making

* **Consensus-Oriented:** Decisions are made collaboratively, aiming for consensus where possible.
* **Lead's Final Say:** The Human Project Lead (VENKATESH C V) holds the final decision-making authority on architectural and strategic matters.
