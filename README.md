# SaaScript - AI-Assisted Development Documentation

Welcome to the `ai-protocol-and-docs` branch for the **SaaScript** project.

This branch serves as the dedicated documentation hub for our AI-assisted development team, containing the protocols, project overviews, and detailed task lists that guide the Software Architect (Archi), Project Lead, and Software Engineer.

It is intended to **never be merged** into main development branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with This Project

1.  **Understand the Team Protocol:**
    * Review the core [AI Team Collaboration Protocol & Guidelines](AI_Team_Protocol.md) to understand AI roles, communication, and operational procedures for all projects.

2.  **Access Project-Specific Context:**
    * Dive into the comprehensive [**SaaScript Project Overview**](saascript.md) for a detailed understanding of its vision, architecture, and core technologies.
    * Explore the [**SaaScript Project Roadmap**](saascript-roadmap.md) to understand the high-level strategic progression of the project.
    * Explore the [**SaaScript Task List Index**](saascript-tasks.md) to see the phase-by-phase breakdown of all development tasks.
